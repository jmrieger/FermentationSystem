# Build Process

# Foreword

# Step 1 - Buy stuff
Acquire all parts listed in components.md

# Step 2 - Prep Reservoir
1. Cut (2) 1.625" holes in the lid of the reservoir.  While it may make structural sense for these holes to be on the top portion of the container itself, I'm opting for the lid to retain as much reservoir space as possible.
2. Install bulkhead into each hole, securing with provided nut & EPDM gaskets.
3. Install threaded -> 90* barb fittings on the outside of each bulkhead
3. Install threaded -> barb fittings on the inside of each bulkhead fitting.  
4. Install hose from one barb to bottom of reservoir.  This will be the return line.  Label this port externally as 'IN'.
5. Install hose from other barb to submersible pump, leaving pump in the bottom of the reservoir.  Drape 110V power cord over tank wall. Label this port externally as 'OUT'

# Step 3 - Prep Fridge Door
1. Cut 2 holes into door for shank.  Hole size TBD based on shanks purchased.  Drill holes near bottom of door, ensuring that the floor of the fridge will be cleared by the shanks.
2. Attach shanks to door, securing appropriately.
3. Attach straight barb fittings to each shank inside door.  Label one 'IN' and one 'OUT' on both sides of door.
4. Attach 90* pex barb elbows to shank on outside of door.

# Step 4 - Prep feed line
1. Cut an approximately 10 foot line of pex.  Attach to the 'OUT' barb fitting from door; crimp appropriately.
2. Crimp a 1/2" PEX Tee on the other end of the 10 foot line of pex.
3. Crimp a short length of PEX inline with the 10 foot line of pex, then crimp the 1/2" plug onto that short length.
4. Crimp a short length of PEX to a 1/2" PEX to 1/2" MNPT fitting.
5. Attach motorized ball valve to the fitting from step 4, using pipe tape as appropriate.  Once attached, crimp short length to PEX tee from step 2.
6. Attach 1" NPT to barb fitting to other end of ball valve.

# Step 5 - Prep return line
1. Cut an approximately 10 foot line of pex.  Attach to the 'IN' barb fitting from door; crimp appropriately.
2. Crimp a 1/2" PEX Tee on the other end of the 10 foot line of pex.
3. Crimp a short length of PEX inline with the 10 foot line of pex, then crimp the 1/2" plug onto that short length.

# Step 6 - Secure Feed & Return Lines
1. Feed & return lines should be mounted to a single board / panel / something to support the valves. MDF  or other plastic panel is suggested

# Step 7 - Leak test the build
1. Attach a short length of poly tubing between the ball valve's barb fitting and the open PEX fitting, securing with a hose clamp on both ends.  This should complete the closed loop.
2. Fill reservoir with approximately 1 gallon of water.
3. Apply a 12V source to ball valve to open it. Red wire is +12V, yellow wire is ground
4. Plug in submersible pump to a surge strip.
5. Turn on surge strip.  Check for leaks; fix as necessary.
